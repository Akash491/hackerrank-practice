    "###### The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.\n",
    "###### For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "###### d = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "###### d['python'].append(\"awesome\")\n",
    "###### d['something-else'].append(\"not relevant\")\n",
    "###### d['python'].append(\"language\")\n",
    "###### for i in d.items():\n",
    "######     print i\n",
    "###### This prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### ('python', ['awesome', 'language'])\n",
    "###### ('something-else', ['not relevant'])\n",
    "###### In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group A. There are m words belonging to word group B. For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Group A contains 'a', 'b', 'a' Group B contains 'a', 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "###### For the first word in group B, 'a', it appears at positions 1 and 3 in group A. The second word, 'c', does not appear in group A, so print -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Expected output:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1 3\n",
    "###### -1\n",
    "##### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The first line contains integers,n and m separated by a space.\n",
    "###### The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.\n",
    "###### The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Constraints\n",
    "###### 1 <= n <= 10000\n",
    "###### 1 <= m <= 100\n",
    "###### 1 <= length of each word in the input <= 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output m lines.\n",
    "###### The ith line should contain the 1-indexed positions of the occurrences of the ith word separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "##### STDIN   Function\n",
    "###### -----   --------\n",
    "###### 5 2     group A size n = 5, group B size m = 2\n",
    "###### a       group A contains 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b'\n",
    "###### a\n",
    "###### b\n",
    "###### a\n",
    "###### b\n",
    "###### a       group B contains 'a', 'b'\n",
    "###### b\n",
    "##### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 1 2 4\n",
    "###### 3 5\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 'a' appeared 3 times in positions 1, 2 and 4.\n",
    "###### 'b' appeared 2 times in positions 3 and 5.\n",
    "###### In the sample problem, if 'c' also appeared in word group B, you would print -1."
